## 0 data loader

The `.py files` in `data_loader package` are as follows:

- **loader.py** : loading cora dataset, extracting node features and edge information, and calculating D<sup>-1/2</sup> A D<sup>-1/2</sup>...

## 1 Basic Pytorch versionï¼š

The `.py files` in `basic_version package` are as follows:

- **layer.py** : Defined Graph Convolution Layer (GraphConv)
- **model.py** : Defined GCN Model which composed by GraphConv
- **evaluator.py** : Used to evaluate our model

## 2 PyG version
